Description:
Infra-Red obstacle detection LEDs (IRE1 and IRE2) are turned ON and OFF every second. 
Messages are printed on the LCD and Serial Monitor accordingly.
WARNING!!!
Infra-Red light can damage your eyes if you look to emmiting IR LED's.
You will not be able to see the LED's emmiting light because human eyes cannot see infra-red light.
You can see the IR LED's light using a camera (from you cell phone or smartphone, for example).
Placing an obstacle 2cm in front of the LEDS should turn IRS1 and IRS2 ON and OFF.
